If you're a beginner- this is a whisky you should try. Before JWB I tried basic versions of JW, Grant's, Ballantine's. To me JWB was on a different level of complexity. This is not a single malt but it has a very smooth, consistent taste, I get notes of tobacco, oak, some grass, smoky finish. Great on ice or with a bit of water. || Really enjoyed this for a while until it started to give me an after taste of soap. Put me off it after that || Boring, flat and bland. Truly unremarkable. || I wanted to like this, but it's really just all a bit flat. You can tell that the flavours are there but they are so reduced to make this all a bit bland, unfortunately. It could really do with a couple of more points on the alcohol percentage. There is a bit of smoke and a bit of toffee and a bit of oil on the tongue, just not enough of any of those factors. Don't add ice or water, any flavour that is there will be nullified. Maybe I'm being harsh coming from some of the big single malt flavours, but I'm always interested in what the blenders can do. I bought this on offer, to contradict myself, I'll keep it to mix with cola and ice, or even IRN BRU. || I want to rate this three stars, but as soon as you’re out for dinner somewhere that doesn’t have a good selection of scotch JWB becomes a five star expression. Probably the best feature is the perfect 50/50 blend of Islay peat smoke and charred oak barrel smoke. Though, I’m still not a fan of the heavy peatedness. And would prefer the oak char only. Nevertheless, on a lot of ice as it is served in bars and restaurants, this totally hits the spot. It’s completely reliable. For the price, this is impossible to beat.

Taste: Woody spices, quite thin in viscosity, watery even, mellow. Once swallowed, the next taste, is hard to distinguish, as the finish covers the flavours in the mouth, tastes like it's been watered down, as it's so thin and smooth, it’s the sort of whisky that you could drink alot of and get very drunk, quite quickly as it's so mild. Finish: Not a strong finish, not aggressive like some other Whisky's, it's milder and more refined, a good whisky for evening drinking, it already tastes like it's been diluted with water or ice. Hints of Pepper and a gentle lingering smokiness, perfect for the table, prehaps with cheese to clean your palette before the next course, would I buy again, yes to share amongst dinner guests who are unsure about Whisky's.

I enjoy malt whisky in a whole range of styles, from smoky Islays to rich ""sherry bombs"" and all points between. But among the sweeter whiskies Aberlour has long been a firm favourite. While the flavours and aromas here are unmistakably Aberlour, the higher ABV and lack of filtration seem to slightly de-emphasise its inherent sweetness and allow significantly more complexity to show through. And though certainly not a ""beginners' malt"", the high ABV is very well integrated and never overly aggressive to drink neat (my own preference). All in all, while the core 12yo expression remains a favourite ""easy-drinker"", this is a whisky that thoroughly rewards more time and attention to savouring and is a real star turn in ""bang for buck"". This seems to no longer be available, and I REALLY hope that is only a temporary situation, as this is a whisky I would love to buy regularly in future as I'm sure others will too. || A tragically ignored gem of a whisky.

Its smooth very tasty and didnt last long in the bottle. For a single malt whisky its way up there. || I was a bit sceptical at first to buy this but boy am I happy I did. This has quickly become my favourite scotch. It's very different and unique. Taste wise it's not something you will find with other scotches. The smokiness comes through more here than anything else I've tried. It's sweet but it isn't overpowering. It goes down smooth and doesn't have much of a bite. If you don't like smoky then this isn't a scotch for you but that balance between sweet and smoky makes every sip its own journey. Amazing. || My favorite whisky. It's so good, and the smell is so great- i kept the bottle just to smell it after i finished the bottle. || Just received my bottle today, it has a nice smokey taste with an undertone which I find reminiscent of saffron. I'm no connoisseur but believe it's a nice whiskey. || Certainly interesting but neither the peat nor the rum finish really stands out in an exceptional way. The flavors aren't anything that can't be found in cheaper scotches. It's not bad, just nothing special.

If you want a whisky to impress but don’t want to blow your budget, give it a whirl – your guest/recipient won’t be disappointed. || Yes have tried this whisky, it is a lovely dram and is very mild . || Have also tried this and agree with the young age part of previous review.I personally think this is about 8 years old at most and it shows in how spirity it is on the nose.I cant find a lot to say about this , apart from along with the Glen Keith of the same packaging it is a very poor offering from Pernod Ricard for both distilleries.I have said of the Glen Keith bottling that an expression of 10-12 years and 46 abv could showcase both distilleries in a better light. || Amazing how a distillery so close to Aberlour can come up with something so different.

The variance in flavor between batches is noticeable and welcome - variations on a theme.  This requires a little patience to open up, but is very rewarding once it does. If you are looking to expand your horizons or are new to this kind of brown water, this is an excellent place to start. || Great whisky, has an excellent taste. Highly recomended! One of my favourites. || Id heard alot of good things about abunadh and so was very interested in trying it. I have to admit at first i was quite disappointed, yes there were some lovely rich flavours but all rather mute. I tried it neat and with a little water and both times with around 20 minutes in the glass before tasting. I cannot claim to be an expert by any stretch of the imagination but i expected a greater experience from this whisky (batch 57 ) 

Now a month on with a quater of the bottle gone my opinion has changed. Its a lovely dram, one that i expected it to be. I think the oxidisation has really helped this bottle open up. I highly recommend it, but definitely needs a bit of time and air. || This is a great bottle, the taste is powerfull and i personaly tryed straight and with water and i prefer straight !

While I'm at it - please stop slating people for adding water or ice to their dram. Its great. Also - stop harping on about the peatiness coming from the water, its nonesense.

Some hints of smoke and earthy moss. On the palate: creamy and clear as spring water, very in line with the nose. Not very deep, but lively and focussed.  It is said to contain a lightly peated young spirit above 8yo and a strongly peated spirit above 18yo. The younger whisky sets the tone: a great serene character which reflects the pine forests  around the distillery (and less complex than the Hakushu 12yo). || A truly special whisky. It's very Green, a start that commences with a fruity mouth like biting info a fresh apple after settling swallowing ice cold water with lime and mint in it.... Then a subtle lapsang souchong flavoured shortbread finish.   I can't do this justice and I'm normally very verbose || This is our favourite Japanese whisky. It is clean and refreshing. We once visited the distillery where Hakushu was produced, and fell in love with this. They did something called 'highball from the wood' using Hakushu, which was sublime.

Malted barley is at the heart of the palate, coated in herbaceous, liquorice, spiced (ginger, cinnamon) and chocolate tones. Very elegant, the mid-palate also delivers plenty of energy and as it draws to a close, fresh tobacco leaves and coconut intertwine to create a natural symphony of aromas. Long, soft.
